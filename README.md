# üè• ER Patient Flow & Doctor Performance Dashboard

## üìò Project Overview

This project, **ER Patient Flow & Doctor Performance Dashboard**, is an end-to-end Power BI analytics solution designed to analyze **Emergency Room (ER) performance** and **Doctor efficiency** within a healthcare environment.

The dashboard integrates patient and doctor datasets to provide a unified, interactive visualization platform. It helps administrators and decision-makers monitor **patient wait times**, **departmental efficiency**, **doctor revenue performance**, and **overall ER operations** in real time.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

* Analyze **ER patient visits** and traffic by department.
* Track and improve **average patient wait times**.
* Measure **doctor revenue** and **patients served**.
* Evaluate **wait time success percentage** as a key performance metric.
* Deliver an **interactive Power BI dashboard** with slicers, KPIs, and visuals.

## üóÇÔ∏è Files Used in This Project

| File Name                                 | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Hospital ER.csv`                         | Contains ER patient data including department, wait times, and gender.        |
| `Doctor_Patients_data.xlsx`               | Contains doctor data with patient IDs, department referrals, and doctor fees. |
| `ER_Doctor_Performance_Dashboard.pbix` | Main Power BI dashboard file combining both datasets.                         |

## üß© Data Model: Star Schema Design

The dashboard follows a **Star Schema Model** for performance optimization and clarity.

### **Tables:**

1. **ER_Data (Fact Table)** ‚Äì Patient ER visit details and wait times.
2. **Doctor_Data (Fact Table)** ‚Äì Doctor performance and patient-level data.
3. **Dim_Department (Dimension Table)** ‚Äì Contains unique department names for model linkage.

### **Relationships:**

* `Dim_Department[department_referral]` ‚Üí `ER_Data[department_referral]` (1:Many)
* `Dim_Department[department_referral]` ‚Üí `Doctor_Data[department_referral]` (1:Many)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Cleaning and ETL Process

All data transformations were performed in **Power Query Editor** in Power BI.

### **Steps Followed:**

1. **Import Datasets:** Loaded both `Hospital ER.csv` and `Doctor_Patients_data.xlsx` into Power BI.
2. **Column Formatting:** Defined appropriate data types for numerical, text, and datetime fields.
3. **Standardized Department Names:**

   * Issue: Inconsistent naming caused slicers to show blanks.
   * Fix: Applied transformations ‚Äî `Clean`, `Trim`, and `Capitalize Each Word`.
4. **Created Dimension Table:**

   ```DAX
   Dim_Department = DISTINCT('Doctor_Data'[department_referral])
   ```
5. **Established Relationships:** Linked both fact tables with `Dim_Department`.
