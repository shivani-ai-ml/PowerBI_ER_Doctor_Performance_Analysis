## üìò Project Overview
![Dashboard Overview](ER_Patient_Doctor_PerformanceDashboard.png)

The **ER Patient Flow & Doctor Performance Dashboard** is a Power BI project built using two datasets ‚Äî `Hospital ER.csv` and `Doctor_Patients_data.xlsx`. It provides a comprehensive analytical overview of **Emergency Room operations** and **Doctor performance**, empowering healthcare administrators to make data-driven decisions about patient management, wait time efficiency, and revenue performance.

This documentation details every phase of the project ‚Äî from data cleaning and modeling to DAX creation, visualization, and validation ‚Äî offering a complete end-to-end Power BI workflow reference.

## üéØ Project Objectives

* Analyze ER patient flow and department-level performance.
* Track average waiting times and identify efficiency gaps.
* Measure doctor revenue and patient load for performance benchmarking.
* Evaluate hospital-wide wait time success rate (‚â§30 minutes).
* Deliver an interactive Power BI dashboard that supports filtering by department and doctor.

## üóÇÔ∏è Files Used

| File Name                                 | Description                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Hospital ER.csv`                         | Contains ER visit-level details including patient ID, wait time (mins), gender, and department referral.     |
| `Doctor_Patients_data.xlsx`               | Contains doctor and patient mapping details, including doctor fees, patient IDs, and department information. |
| `AR_ER_Doctor_Performance_Dashboard.pbix` | Main Power BI file containing the data model, measures, and visuals.                                         |
| `ER_Doctor_Performance_Dashboard-2.pdf`   | Exported static version of the final dashboard for quick reference or portfolio display.                     |

## üß© Data Model: Star Schema Design

The dashboard is structured around a **Star Schema** model for optimized querying and scalability.

### Tables

* **ER_Data (Fact Table):** Contains patient-level ER data.
* **Doctor_Data (Fact Table):** Contains doctor and consultation-level data.
* **Dim_Department (Dimension Table):** Centralized reference of department names.

### Relationships

* `Dim_Department[department_referral]` ‚Üí `ER_Data[department_referral]` (1:Many)
* `Dim_Department[department_referral]` ‚Üí `Doctor_Data[department_referral]` (1:Many)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Cleaning and ETL Steps

All transformations were performed in **Power Query Editor**.

1. **Load Data:** Imported both CSV and Excel sources into Power BI.
2. **Ensure Correct Data Types:** Converted numeric and text fields appropriately (e.g., `Wait Time (Mins)` as Number, `Doctor Fee` as Decimal).
3. **Department Name Standardization:**

   * Applied `Transform ‚Üí Format ‚Üí Clean` to remove hidden characters.
   * Applied `Transform ‚Üí Format ‚Üí Trim` to remove trailing spaces.
   * Applied `Transform ‚Üí Format ‚Üí Capitalize Each Word` for consistency.
4. **Created Department Dimension Table:**

   ```DAX
   Dim_Department = DISTINCT('Doctor_Data'[department_referral])
   ```
5. **Established Relationships:** Connected the dimension to both fact tables via `department_referral`.

## üßÆ DAX Measures (Correct and Explained)

### ER_Data Table

**1. Total ER Visits**
Counts total visit records.

```DAX
Total ER Visits = COUNTROWS('ER_Data')
```

**2. Avg Wait Time (Mins)**
Calculates average waiting time per patient.

```DAX
Avg Wait Time (Mins) = AVERAGE('ER_Data'[Wait Time (Mins)])
```

**3. Wait Time Success %**
Determines the percentage of ER visits with waiting time ‚â§ 30 minutes.

```DAX
Wait Time Success % =
VAR TotalVisits = COUNTROWS('ER_Data')
VAR SuccessfulVisits = CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('ER_Data'),
    'ER_Data'[Wait Time (Mins)] <= 30
)
RETURN
DIVIDE(SuccessfulVisits, TotalVisits, 0)
```

### Doctor_Data Table

**4. Total Doctor Revenue**
Calculates overall revenue from all doctors.

```DAX
Total Doctor Revenue = SUM('Doctor_Data'[Doctor Fee])
```

**5. Total Patients Served**
Counts the number of unique patients handled by each doctor.

```DAX
Total Patients Served = DISTINCTCOUNT('Doctor_Data'[patient_id])
```

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Creating DAX Measures in Power BI

1. Go to **Report View** (chart icon on the left pane).
2. In the **Fields** panel, right-click the target table (ER_Data or Doctor_Data) ‚Üí **New Measure**.
3. Paste the desired DAX formula.
4. Press **Enter**.
5. Format the measure using **Measure Tools** (Percentage, Currency, or Decimal).
6. If an error appears under column names, copy the exact field name from **Data View** and replace it in the DAX formula.
